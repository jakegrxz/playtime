<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Part II: Untying the Paradox</strong></p>

<p>Although any attempt to â€œabolishâ€ the Paradox is basically doomed to failâ€”as will become clearer belowâ€”we can hope at the very least to <em>understand</em> it, and where it comes from. Perhaps the best way to initiate this task of understanding is to ask the following question: why is it the Paradox of the <em>Proletarian</em>? Why are the middle classes and the bourgeoisie â€œexemptâ€, so to speak, from this trap?</p>

<p>There is one particular example that I think can help us begin to answer these questions, and itâ€™s a phenomenon known as â€œclass tourismâ€<sup id="fnref:M" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:M" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Class tourism essentially describes a practice of certain members of the middle and upper classes, whereby they venerate and appropriate cultural symbols and practices usually associated with the working class (e.g. ways of dressing, speaking, making music, eating, etc), while still, ultimately, living a comfortable middle-class life. Through this, these symbols are emptied of their meaningful content so that they can become window dressing for these classes: it gives them a bit of â€œedgeâ€, â€œspiceâ€, or a veneer of â€œauthenticityâ€. In other words, these practices are ripped out of their context of emergence, often one of real poverty and struggle, and are reduced to superficial <em>appearances</em>. (A very specific of example of this might be, for instance, white middle-class â€œfansâ€ of grime or hip-hop, who usuallyâ€”but certainly not always!â€”simply like the â€œbeatâ€ or immediate sensation of the music, without engaging at all with the culture behind the music, which is intimately bound up with a whole host of social, political and economic issues.)</p>

<p>Although it may seem obvious what the problem is here, lets challenge ourselves to make it explicit. The problem is this: <em>these middle-class â€œtouristsâ€ are  essentially fetishists</em>. They fetishise working-class life, which is the same as saying that they reduce it to a set of representative images without any depth; in other words, what matters is the <em>image of the thing</em> rather than the thing itself. (Indeed, for the fetishist, the former comes to replace and stand in for the latter.) Consider how the favoured buzzwords of the middle-class fetishists are â€œrealâ€ or â€œauthenticâ€, connoting how a particular style of music or cuisine has emerged from â€œrealâ€ people living in â€œrealâ€ poverty with â€œrealâ€ struggles, to such an extent that this actual struggle has infused the style itself with some mystical â€œrawâ€ aura.  Now, thereâ€™s a hilarious irony here in that, if the middle-class fetishist is appropriating something from elsewhere that isnâ€™t theirs, then any attempt here to be â€œauthenticâ€ is in fact clearly <em>inauthentic</em>, an utterly pathetic charade<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. Everyone who isnâ€™t the fetishist can see this clearly, and laughs heartily as a result, but the fetishist doesnâ€™t see this problem because for them <em>the thing and the image of the thing coincide</em>: the style and the struggle it emerged from are effectively equivalent, in such a way that the style effectively embodies the struggle behind it, and the struggle is ultimately expressible as a series of symbols. It is through this magical act of equivalence that the fetishist is able to <strong>a)</strong> feel as if they are experiencing a â€œrealâ€ â€œrawnessâ€ when engaging with working-class culture<sup id="fnref:G" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:G" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, while also <strong>b)</strong> essentially seeing working-class culture as a series of floating symbols and styles that can be exchanged just like any other. The reader will notice a clear contradiction hereâ€”how can something be more â€œrawâ€ and â€œrealâ€ if it is just a â€œfloating symbol like any otherâ€?â€”but it is precisely the magical effacement (read: repression) of this contradiction that defines the fetishist <em>as such</em>, recalling that the word â€œfetishâ€ was first coined to describe the mythologies and religions of â€œprimitiveâ€ peoples in the colonised world, specifically their attributing of magical or supernatural powers to particular objects, such as totems. Fetishism has always been an affair of magic.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>There is another way of describing this fetishism. If fetishism is based off a kind of overabundant positivity (meaning is jam-packed into very specific objects, overflowing them), then we can say that a constitutive error it makes is to <em>ignore the negative dimension of language</em>. Language is ultimately made possible by a murky realm <em>outside</em> language, a point which Alain Badiou, via Samuel Beckett, terms â€œthe unnameableâ€. This sounds complicated, but thereâ€™s actually a very easy way to demonstrate it. Imagine a dog. Itâ€™s by your side, yapping at you; itâ€™s hungry. Now try and to define this dog without using the word â€œdogâ€. (Have a go, then return to this text.) You might have come up with something like â€œanimal with four legs often kept as a pet by humansâ€, then realised this wasnâ€™t specific enough (this could include cats), so changed it to â€œbarking animal with four legs often kept as a pet by humansâ€. But then you think: what if a dog loses a leg; does it stop being a dog? And what do I mean by â€œanimalâ€? You clasp your hands to your head at the enormity of the task and start breaking down, realising that this entire time language had been a fragile house of cards teetering over the brink of an a-linguistic void. For as soon as you lost the word â€œdogâ€, you lost any hold on the thing you were attempting to name. No words seem to be able express the yapping thing beside youâ€”the â€œdefinitionâ€ just isnâ€™t an adequate replacement. Curled in a foetal position on the floor, you stare down at your leg, and all you see is the hideous thing emitting its yaps and growls. Before long, it starts gnawing at your leg for sustenance. You look into it; all you see now is an unnameable horror. The Thing; I must name The Thing, you thinkâ€¦ finally, you exclaim â€œdog!!!â€ and suddenly, looking in its eyes again, you see a friendly, fluffy Collie licking your shin; the wound is gone.</p>

<p>If that demonstration descended into schlocky horror, it is because the unnameable is something naturally horrific or traumatic: hence the endless SF and horror films with titles such as <em>The Thing</em>, <em>It Came From Outer Space</em>, and, quite literally, <em>The Unnameable</em>. Putting that aside, the point is that language is not simply a set of labels that we stick on top of â€œthingsâ€ that exist separately to, or before, language. Language is instead that which <em>makes these things â€œthingsâ€ in the first place</em>, which cuts something out of an indeterminate, pre-linguistic multitude and gives it a name. Although this fact becomes effaced through the regular and routinised use of language, every single symbol we encounter has its genesis in this way. The fundamental trauma of language is that its conditions of existence exist <em>outside</em> language, at what Giorgio Agamben <a href="https://www.lacan.com/badeurope.htm">has called</a> that â€œstrange point in which language and real in a way coincideâ€.</p>

<p>So, if we return to our middle-class â€œtouristsâ€, we can see that they make the quite easy mistake of ignoring or repressing the unnameable, and essentially treating the world as if it was just an endless, floating array of intelligible symbols that can be exchanged and used at whim. (The fundamental myth here is that language is its own foundation, and thus that everything can and indeed does have a name; thus we can freely appropriate symbols and names from elsewhere.) The working-class people whose â€œcultureâ€ (to use a rather blunt term, all too aware of the paradoxical trap that is constantly beneath us in these discussions) is being appropriated, though, know that these ways of life are not mere symbols. They emerged out of the brute, unnameable realities of their existence which no available words, styles or symbols seemed to accurately express; consequently, they had to come up with their own. Through their real struggles, they know that the unnameable is the thing that drives us to name, and to create new names. They know intimately, in short, that language has its limits; that it is a wager, a hedging of oneâ€™s bets, a leap over the unnameable.
<!--description--></p>
<p style="text-align: center">*</p>

<p>We are close here to honing in on the answer to our initial question (why the Paradox of the <em>Proletarian</em>?). And we can get there by considering the opposite scenario to the one above. In other words, instead of considering â€œclass tourismâ€ (bourgeois and middle-class people doing â€œworking-classâ€ things), let us consider â€œreverse class tourismâ€ (working-class people doing â€œmiddle-classâ€ or â€œbourgeoisâ€ things).</p>

<p>Immediately, we realise that this isnâ€™t really a thing â€” we donâ€™t get the same bad feeling from working-class people doing â€œmiddle-classâ€ things as we do from the contrary. If a working-class person tries to work their way up and climb the ladders of class, saving up, say, for a deposit on a house, or aspiring to be a manager at their workplace, no middle-class person is seriously going to claim that they are â€œappropriating middle-class cultureâ€. Itâ€™s such a ridiculous argument that Iâ€™m laughing as Iâ€™m typing this. Indeed, the <em>opposite</em> is much more likely to be true: the middle-class person will welcome the â€œaspirationalâ€, â€œhard-workingâ€ working-class tourist into their ranks, setting them up against the languid, idle proles who refuse to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. They even have a name for it: â€œsocial mobilityâ€.</p>

<p>Again, the reasons for this might seem obvious, but letâ€™s challenge ourselves to make it explicit. One sentence will suffice: <em>there is no such thing as middle-class culture</em>. Or, if there is a middle-class culture, it is constitutively empty, hollow, and dead behind the eyes. Nothing the middle class does â€œbelongsâ€ to them, as in the case of what we can clumsily and inaccurately call â€œworking-class cultureâ€: instead, the middle class are defined by the fact that they are always anxious to do the â€œdone thingâ€, the thing that has already been articulated, established, and socially sanctioned (in other words, put into language). Whether it be dutifully studying hard at school to get into a good university, applying for graduate jobs in the professional sectors, or settling down with a mortgage as soon as possible, the middle class are never acting on their own accord; they are always acting with one anxious eye on what I will call <em>the State</em>. (This term gesturing towards not only the various apparatuses of the state conventionally understood, but also something akin to Lacan/Zizekâ€™s â€œBig Otherâ€ â€” the all-seeing eye of public morality and normality.) The middle class have always been the class of the State: the working class are effectively ignored and exploited by it, while the bourgeoisie and aristocracy are both canny and powerful enough to make the State submit to their ends. (Perhaps this explains why the quintessential middle-class profession has always been working for the civil service or other State bureaucracy.)</p>

<p>This allegiance between the middle class and the State explains why â€œreverse class tourismâ€ doesnâ€™t exist: <em>because there is nothing from â€œmiddle-class cultureâ€ that could be appropriated</em>; it all already belongs to the State. Andâ€”this is the crucial pointâ€”this is the exact same thing as saying that everything the middle class does <em>can be uncontroversially represented</em>. Whereas we got caught in paradoxical knots trying to faithfully talk about or â€œrepresentâ€ the working class, no such issue exists for the middle class. I can say â€œmiddle-class people have mortgagesâ€ or â€œmiddle-class people are boringâ€ and no one will accuse me of either romanticising or denigrating them, or of robbing them of their voice. Yes, perhaps some would quibble with the particulars of this statement (â€œbut some middle-class people actually do X/Y/Zâ€), but certainly no-one would accuse the statement of being oppressive or harmful. After all, with their good access to education and relatively secure economic position, and thus fluent in the language of the State (i.e. the dominant, official, â€œhighest valueâ€ language of a territory), the middle class can simply <em>speak back and be heard</em>. In some way, the middle class always has the State to back them up â€” much unlike the working class.</p>

<p>Why? Because of the very intimateâ€”perhaps even innateâ€”link between the State and language. Leaning heavily on Badiouâ€™s theorisation of the State, we can say that the very logic of the State <em>is</em> <em>representation</em>, in contrast to presentation or unpresentation. This logic manifests itself in two different senses.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">5</a></sup> First, the State employs <strong>political representation</strong>: it represents the People by being their representative, standing in for them, and embodying the popular will. (In other words, the State is the image of the People.) Secondly, though, the State also employs <strong>symbolic representation</strong>: it is continually collecting snapshots of its people, forging representations of them, in order to manage them. (In other words, the People are images for the State.) This symbolic representation has always been one of the Stateâ€™s core functions, from as far back to the first major civilisations in (e.g) Rome and Mesopotamia, which were consistently tallying and logging their available resources, such as taxes, soldiers, and food supplies. By the time of the 18th and 19th centuries, following recent developments in probability theory, this activity had evolved into what came to be known as <em>statistics</em>: which, literally, means â€œthe science of the Stateâ€. And today, this has evolved into the near-constant practice of harvesting and extracting data from populations through information and communications technologies, and an accordant obsession with â€œdata-ledâ€ marketing, strategy, decision-making, and so on.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Throughout this all, there is one constant thread. <em>First</em>, things happen; they are presented. <em>Then</em>, afterwards, the State tries to make sense of it; it <em>re</em>-presents those things, in order to manage and control them. This is the order; it is always the order. In 2500 BC, a Mesopotamian bureaucrat tallies the barley collected that day, and rations it between the various employees of the temple; in 2021, a British civil servant runs a regression analysis on recently collected census data, in order to assist policymaking. Over four thousand years of history stand between these events; they remain, nonetheless, analogous. And it all has to do with representation.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">*</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As all things change to fire,<br />
and fire exhausted<br />
falls back into things,<br />
the crops are sold<br />
for money spent on food.</p>

  <p>â€”Heraclitus, Fragment 22</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What has emerged, then, is a knot of three particular elements: the State, class, and language (or representation). We proposeâ€”again under the influence of Badiouâ€”to better understand this untidy knot through the sifting out of three â€œlevelsâ€, so to speak:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1) The Unpresented</strong>: Also known as the unnameable, the traumatic Real, the very condition of language that â€œexistsâ€ outside language. The unnameable and unspeakable point where language and the Real coincide (echoing Agamben above).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2) The Presented</strong>: The raw â€œhappeningâ€ of any particular event, the dimension that makes it unique from anything that has happened before. This level is not outside language, but on the very edge of it: in that it <em>presents</em> itself to us, it does so through symbols and signs, but the meaning of these has not been fixed yet, and all they seem to name is themselves <em>as</em> names. These names are, in linguistics, known as â€œproper namesâ€.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>3) The Represented</strong>: The particular set of presented events that are explicitly recognised and given expression (â€œrepresentedâ€) by the State.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The numbering here is important, because there is a logical order that exists between these three. First, always first, is the void of the unpresented, the unnameable. It is indifferent; it is everywhere and nowhere; it is what drives us to name, to create language. Then, there is the presented: those novel events that emerge from that void first level, that blatantly <em>present</em> themselves to us, but we lack any suitable images or signs (i.e. representations) that we could use to make them intelligible. Consequently, people make up their own. (Example: clubgoers and DJs begin to pick up on a new â€œsceneâ€, a new sound, that seems to be emerging and solidifying into form. No available genre name is quite right, though, so, in a messy, collective way, they eventually create and decide upon one.) Finally, we have the <em>represented</em>, the presentation of presentation: the translation of these presented events into fixed symbols or names, which then come to stand in for (i.e. represent) them. (Example: over time, this new genre solidifies into form. It becomes an established genre, gets its own Top 40 chart, begins getting played on the radio, and perhaps even gets taught in the State music curriculum. The consequence of this, of course, is that the genre loses its â€œsoulâ€ â€” it becomes detached from the unpresented level that originally gave it its edge and novelty and turned into a pure, empty representation.)</p>

<p>We can also observe another pattern as we progress through these ordered levels: they move from the universal to the particular. The void is clearly the most universal; no one, ultimately, can escape it. Indeed, it is so indifferent, so purely empty, that it is almost beyond universality altogether. Then we move up to the presented, which follows the logic of <em>singularity</em>, or uniqueness. At the level of raw presentation, everything is unique, and happening for both the first and last times. The unique presentation is not so much a particular thing as what Deleuze and Guattari, via Duns Scotus, would call a <em>haecceity</em>: a pure happening <em>in its very happening</em>, open and ongoing, rather than retroactively delimited as a fixed particular. (Deleuze and Guattari use the example of a season, an hour, or perhaps a gust of wind: individualities that lack any kind of fixed â€œbodyâ€ or form and yet nonetheless exist perfectly as individualities.) Finally, once we have reached the level of the represented, we are in the realm of <em>particularity</em>. Everything here has been given its proper place, its particular position in the State machine. The open, ambivalent happenings of presentation have become â€œthingsâ€, cut off from other things, their relations obfuscated.</p>

<p>From this we can then pinpoint the difference between the working class and the middle class (from a â€œlinguisticâ€ point of view): <em>the working class exist between the unpresented and the presented, while the middle class exist between the presented and the represented</em><sup id="fnref:J" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:J" class="footnote">7</a></sup>. In other words, to use some somewhat clunky terminology, <em>the working class are â€œcloserâ€ to that unnameable level</em> where language and the Real meet than the middle class, who are more concerned with the third level of representation. (As demonstrated by the classically middle-class activity of â€œkeeping up <em>appearances</em>â€.) Although anyone in principle can â€œaccessâ€ the first level (see below), the working class tend to confront it more â€œnaturallyâ€, by virtue of their economic position and relation to the State.<sup id="fnref:K" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:K" class="footnote">8</a></sup> Taken for granted and ignored, and not fluent in the State/Masterâ€™s language, the working-class person has essentially two choices: one, play the State/Masterâ€™s game, learn its language, and aspire to become middle class (thereby leaving the working class behind); or two, <em>go their own way</em>, aspiring to excellence (through, for example, making music/art/poetry/etc or starting a community project such as a social centre or soup kitchen) while staying â€œtrueâ€, so to speak, to their background. If they pick the latter, they quickly learn that there is no one that can help them apart from their friends, family and those in their community who share their situation, acting through a labour of love without a single guarantee of return. There are no wealthy benefactors or rich parents to finance these endeavours, and funding from the State or any other bureaucracy is scarce, for it is designed for projects that can immediately benefit themselves, rather than the autonomous hopes and dreams of the working-class aspirant. With no pre-available, already-represented â€œpathâ€ that they can simply follow, then, the aspirant is naturally confronted with a voidâ€”the unnameableâ€”which humbly reminds them of one sober fact: <em>if they want to do this, they will have to do it themselves</em>. This brush with the void, however, is precisely what makes the aspirantâ€™s work <em>matter</em>: it secures the workâ€™s uniqueness, novelty and value, for it means that without the aspirant and the community behind it, the work would not exist. In other words, this work is something that genuinely can be said to <em>belong</em> to the working-class aspirants and communities that give rise to it.<sup id="fnref:X" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:X" class="footnote">9</a></sup> The work has not yet been secured and represented by the State, it is not simply another floating image, but instead a fragile, precious, and above all <em>real</em> activity  profoundly rooted in the unnameable realities out of which it was given life.</p>

<p>This is what we mean, then, when we say that the working class are naturally (though certainly not exclusively) â€œcloserâ€ to this unnameable level. Now, at this point let us recall that the first level is also the most universal: the unnameable point, the void, in that it is the very condition of language, concerns at the very least <em>everybody</em>. (After all, even though the middle classes (e.g.) are constantly engaged in the activity of repressing this void, in principle any member of them <em>could</em>, should they realise its necessity, dare to face it head-on.) Taking this universality into consideration, we can rephrase our conclusion from the previous paragraph, and say that the working classes <em>are â€œcloserâ€ to a generic universal condition of humanity</em> than the middle classes. As the repressed element of society that people would rather not confront and think about, they are the â€œpart of no partâ€ (Zizek) that unveils the truth of the entire society that they are a part of. Much like the unintended Freudian slip unveils what we were actually thinking buried beneath the stifling layers of egotism and social niceties, those moments where â€œthe mask slipsâ€ and we see capitalismâ€™s exploitation of the working class laid bare are when we realise what capitalismâ€”and, perhaps, humanityâ€”<em>genuinely</em> is beneath its projected images of free trade and liberty.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">10</a></sup> This is what we are hinting towards when we say that the working class are â€œcloserâ€ to some kind of universal condition.</p>

<p>This statement of universality needs to be very precisely understood, however. First, it is <em>not</em> saying that the working class <em>as they are right now</em> are a kind of universal subject (in the sense that would lead one to say something gross like â€œwe are all working classâ€). The reason for this is quite simple: inequality, brutally, <em>exists</em>. The working class might be â€œcloserâ€â€”whatever that might exactly meanâ€”to a generic universal condition of humanity, but they still retain their particular existence: something most succinctly demonstrated by the fact that crossing an ocean is a life-threatening necessity for refugees, but a luxury cruise for the rich. To ignore this difference is to fall into the Paradoxâ€™s trap of romanticisation, yet again;  it is to fetishise the working class and to act as if everything they do right now is â€œprogressiveâ€ or â€œgoodâ€ or â€œsubversiveâ€. (Which is, of course, to patronise and denigrate them; the other trap of the Paradox.) The problem here is that we try and jump to the universal too quickly; we simply copy and paste some particular practice and immediately elevate it to being some kind of universal code of conduct. But this simply reduces the universal to a finite, particular attribute; in other words, something not universal at all.<sup id="fnref:I" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:I" class="footnote">11</a></sup></p>

<p>Secondly and relatedly, â€œuniversal condition of humanityâ€ should not be taken to mean â€œeverybody is the sameâ€. Universality presupposes an â€œallâ€, an â€œeverybodyâ€ or â€œeverythingâ€; it does not, however, logically follow from this that â€œeverybody <em>is the same</em>â€ in the sense of â€œhomogeneousâ€. In short, universality is not identity or homogeneity.</p>

<p>What my argument <em>is</em> saying, then, is that the working class can, potentially, stand in for everybody. One need only consider the usual demands and slogans of proletarian movements to see this in action: whether it be demanding universal healthcare, welfare, or rights, proletarian movements never ask for things for â€œthemselvesâ€, but for <em>everybody</em>, â€œfor allâ€. The reason for this is the old Marxist point that the working class is the only class whose self-expression involves its self-negation â€” in other words, the working class is the only class that ultimately seeks to abolish itself, via the abolition of class society and inequality all together.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">12</a></sup> It would be absurd, for example, for a proletarian movement to demand things <em>just</em> for the working class. Consider healthcare: if a proletarian movement demanded free healthcare, but only for â€œworking classâ€ people (defined in practice, say, by a certain income level), the implication would be that they are completely fine with rich people a) existing and b) receiving most likely superior private healthcare. This vision, evidently, solves nothing; it is essentially what we have now. Instead, authentic proletarian politics always goes further: it dares to speak for/as an <em>all</em>, and to upend the entire system <em>altogether</em>.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>

<p>Proletarian politics is therefore never about representation; it is never about the recognition of the rights of a particular, already-constituted group. Instead, mediating between the unpresented and the presented, all proletarian politics takes the form of a <em>wager</em>, a leap over the unnameable void, a gamble on what it <em>is</em> or could become<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">14</a></sup>. The proletarian movement is constantly taking a chance on itself, testing out what it can do, and, consequently, is never entirely sure of what it is doing, or who exactly it is speaking â€œforâ€ â€” and while these issues demand temporary and pragmatic fixes in the heat of any particular political struggle, they are also what ultimately grounds this struggleâ€™s universalism, and its potential to, in principle, upend the entire system.<sup id="fnref:XX" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:XX" class="footnote">15</a></sup></p>

<p>When a proletarian movement expresses the demand â€œFree Healthcare for Allâ€, for example, it is not saying â€œwe are a particular group of people, we believe in universal healthcare, and we want this taken into account and representedâ€. No â€” instead, proletarian politics definitively <em>begins</em> when this representationalist frame is smashed open, when the very delimitations on what can even <em>be</em> represented are called into question. Saying â€œFree Healthcare for Allâ€ is not so much about representing the interests of a particular group, but making that very demand <em>sayable</em> for an ever-larger group of people. This is, againâ€”as I have been saying throughout this essayâ€”an expression of the different relationship to language that the working class have compared to, say, the middle class. For the middle class, what matters primarily is <em>what</em> is said: the focus is on â€œsaying the right thingsâ€, being â€œrespectableâ€, conforming to established social and political etiquette, etc. By contrast, though the content of a demand (<em>what</em> it says) clearly also concerns proletarian politics, what perhaps matters more to it is the very fact <em>that</em> such a demand was said at all. It is the very act, the Event, of speaking upâ€”moreso than â€œwhoâ€ exactly speaks or â€œwhatâ€ is spokenâ€”that counts. This is a decisively more <em>interventionist</em> approach to language than the middle class are used to. The language of proletarian demands is never designed to â€œrepresentâ€ a fixed reality, but to immanently cut into and change it. As such, it is impossible to fix a working-class subject of enunciation: for the very <em>saying</em> of a demand recomposes the subject-group that (supposedly) representatively â€œsaidâ€ it. And it is precisely this feedback loop, this lack of closure, that ensures the universalism of proletarian politics.</p>

<p>In other words, there is never a definite subject of enunciation behind such proletarian slogans; there is always a little crack, an opening, a lack of closure, which foundationally <em>must</em> be there if the slogan is to speak â€œfor allâ€. This is not the case for, say, nationalist politics, which is always obsessed with â€œspeaking forâ€ (i.e. representing) an always-already constitutedâ€”and above all <em>particular</em>â€”group of people (those of a particular racial/ethnic/national group). A slogan like â€œClose the Bordersâ€, for example, is always very clearly spoken by and for an already-constituted, already-recognisable subject (e.g. â€œthe Englishâ€), and thereby one with very definite and violent boundaries. Wagering on the universal, proletarian politicsâ€”to many on the rightâ€™s derisionâ€”never has this surety. Its starting point is not an already-given (i.e. <em>a posteriori</em>) subject of experience, but an <em>a priori</em> axiom that cannot be proved, and can only be assumed to be true on faith: â€œEveryone is equal.â€ Holding this close to its heart, it leaps into action.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">*</p>

<p>And so, following this long meandering journey through fetishism, class, language, representation, and the State, we are now in a position to conclude why the Paradox is decisively the Paradox <em>of the Proletarian</em>: because it is only the working class that can, potentially, stand in for the whole of humanity; because it is the working class that is â€œclosestâ€ to this unnameable universal â€œbaselineâ€. What we have done here is not â€œsolveâ€ the Paradoxâ€”this was never our intentionâ€”but rather indicate and uncover its â€œsourceâ€, which is precisely this: <em>the (difficulty in speaking the) universal</em>. The reason we got caught in paradoxical knots trying to speak of or give a voice to the working class, ending up either romanticising or denigrating them, is precisely because the working class is never â€œjustâ€ the working class as a particular socio-economic category, but always a kind of ambivalent symbol of the â€œmassesâ€ <em>as a whole</em>, the â€œuniversal human conditionâ€. The activities of the working class never really belong to â€œthemâ€ as a particular socio-economic or linguistic category, but are instead, <em>directly and immediately</em>, the brute churnings of history, of life, of productionâ€¦ If the working class has an â€œessenceâ€, then, it is one that can only be <em>active</em>, on the move. Hence why every attempt to name the working classâ€”which, by necessity, must statically fix together symbols and meaningsâ€”feels intuitively wrong: a prison cell of particularity.</p>

<p>Indeed, understanding the working class essentially involves us adopting a rather different approach to language than we are usually accustomed to. If we remain at the level of language as a series of literal (which is to say, again, already-constituted, recognised, accepted) meanings, then we will never attain any serious level of understanding of the working-class â€œessenceâ€, if one can use such a word. Due to its position â€œbetweenâ€ the unpresented and the presented, as I argued above, the working class is not a subject that can be literally â€œreadâ€ â€” the outcome of this was those deeply weird sentiments of â€œpaying rent is working-classâ€ or â€œgoing to McDonalds is working-classâ€ that we cited in Part I, which, again, can only denigrate or romanticise the working class. Instead of this literal approach, there is a curious sense in which we must approach the working class in the same way that we approach an avant-garde artwork or a religious text: one riddled with allegories, symbolism, and misleading pathways that often lead nowhere. For much like an artwork or poem whose meaning seems only capable of being <em>experienced</em> rather than understood, the â€œmeaningâ€ of the working class is not something that will speak to us in literal, State-approved terms, but can only be experienced as a real historical movement: the visceral coming-to-be of the proletariat. Provided we can step out of the often unhelpful straitjacket of language, therefore, we need not succumb to the Paradoxâ€™s paralysis. Indeed, we can even hope to learn from it.</p>

      <p>For clarityâ€™s sake, this is not me arguing that itâ€™s bad for middle-class people to partake in or enjoy the kind of working-class styles, music, cuisines etc invoked here.

      <p>The term â€œworking-class cultureâ€ is, of course, pretty problematic (as I mention a few paragraphs below this).

      <p>Needless to say, my arguments in this post are not designed to apply to these â€œkindsâ€ of fetishism; instead they are a playful reworking akin to Marxâ€™s â€œcommodity fetishismâ€.Â <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>This argument is derived from Marx (via Spivakâ€™s â€œCan the Subaltern Speakâ€) in <em>The Eighteenth Brumaire</em>, who highlights these two slightly different senses of representation by employing two different German words: <em>vertreten</em> (â€œstand in forâ€, â€œdeputiseâ€, â€œbe a representative ofâ€ = political representation) and <em>darstellen</em> (to describe or portray = symbolic representation).Â <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Indeed, the obsession with data and statistics has spread so far that nation-states no longer have a monopoly on it; perhaps one of the most significant political developments of the past 30 years has been the ascent of tech giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook, whose prime commodity is, precisely, data, collected from these platformâ€™s users. What is interesting and perhaps novel is that these companies maintain the Stateâ€™s acts of symbolic representation, translating peopleâ€™s real activities into processable bits of data, <em>but jettison entirely any notion of political representation</em>. Neither Google, Amazon nor Facebook make any pretense to represent â€œthe Peopleâ€ as a collective subject, or embody some popular will; indeed, they are essentially predicated on the assumption that such a collective cannot exist. Gone are any notions of collective purpose, interest or desire, replaced with the paltry substitutes of individual <em>tastes</em> and <em>preferences</em>.Â <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>The reader will probably have noticed by this point that the upper class/bourgeoisie have quietly slipped out of the picture over this preceding section.

      <p>A lot of the language here is clunky and hazy.

      <p>An example I always come back to on this point is the BLM protests last year. Racists hate the slogan â€œBlack Lives Matterâ€ because they mistakenly take it to mean â€œ<em>Only</em> Black Lives Matterâ€, which they then retorted to with â€œAll Lives Matterâ€. BLM activists then correctly noted that â€œBlack Lives Matterâ€ doesnâ€™t mean â€œOnly Black Lives Matterâ€, but rather â€œAll Lives Canâ€™t Matter Until Black Lives Matterâ€. This is the problem of â€œjumping too quicklyâ€ to the universal in a nutshell. By quickly asserting â€œAll Lives Matterâ€, the racists were simply reducing that â€œAllâ€ to a particular groupâ€”white people. Instead the true universalism here was practiced by the BLM activists, who correctly understood that the only true path to the universal (â€œall lives matterâ€) was through the speaking up of a particular group that had been hitherto excluded from this false universal (â€œblack lives matterâ€). James Joyce, 1922: â€œIn the particular is contained the universal.â€ BLM protester, 2020: â€œAll lives canâ€™t matter until black lives matter.â€Â <a href="#fnref:5" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>The middle classes and bourgeoisie, by contrast, are utterly particular, being small protected enclaves that have, over time, climbed out of and built walls to defend themselves from this â€œgeneric universal conditionâ€. Consider those family stories that are passed down generations, of how oneâ€™s ancestors, at some point, â€œworked their way upâ€ and finally achieved that mythic escape from wretched povertyâ€”in all of these there is always one recurring theme: <em>they started from â€œthe bottomâ€</em>. The middle classes and bourgeoisie can only ever define themselves in relation to this kind of generic, universal â€œbaselineâ€ out of which they, at some point, climbed; by contrast, the working class, in their capacity of standing in for this generic universal, need no exterior agent or class in which to define themselves.Â <a href="#fnref:I" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:6" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>See the <em>The Holy Family</em> passage below on this. (â€œâ€¦it cannot emancipate itself without abolishing the conditions of its own life. It cannot abolish the conditions of its own life without abolishing all the inhuman conditions of life of society today which are summed up in its own situation.â€) This is obviously not the case for the bourgeoisie, whose politics ultimately always boil down to a self-interested clinging on to power, and a maintenance of the status quo of inequality.Â <a href="#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>The reader may have noted a subtle semantic shift in this paragraph, from â€œworking classâ€ to â€œproletarianâ€. I use â€œproletarianâ€ to designate the working class in its more â€œactiveâ€ mode, in its self-realisation. This is necessary because, as our review of the Paradox in Part I demonstrated, one gets caught in linguistic knots whenever one tries to pin down the working class as a transparent, clear, representable subject that does things.Â <a href="#fnref:8" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>This is said, more eloquently, by Marx and Engels in <em>The Holy Family</em> â€“ and basically gets to the heart of this piece despite having been written in 1844: â€œWhen socialist writers ascribe this world-historic role to the proletariat, it is not at all, as Critical Criticism pretends to believe, because they regard the proletarians asÂ <em>gods</em>. Rather the contrary. Since in the fully-formed proletariat the abstraction of all humanity, even of theÂ <em>semblance</em>Â of humanity, is practically complete; since the conditions of life of the proletariat sum up all the conditions of life of society today in their most inhuman form; since man has lost himself in the proletariat, yet at the same time has not only gained theoretical consciousness of that loss, but through urgent, no longer removable, no longer disguisable, absolutely imperativeÂ <em>need</em>Â â€” the practical expression ofÂ <em>necessity</em>Â â€” is driven directly to revolt against this inhumanity, it follows that the proletariat can and must emancipate itself. But it cannot emancipate itself without abolishing the conditions of its own life. It cannot abolish the conditions of its own life without abolishing all the inhuman conditions of life of society today which are summed up in its own situation. Not in vain does it go through the stern but steeling school ofÂ <em>labour</em>. <strong>It is not a question of what this or that proletarian, or even the whole proletariat, at the momentÂ <em>regards</em>Â as its aim. It is a question ofÂ <em>what the proletariat is</em>, and what, in accordance with thisÂ <em>being</em>, it will historically be compelled to do.</strong> Its aim and historical action is visibly and irrevocably foreshadowed in its own life situation as well as in the whole organization of bourgeois society today. There is no need to explain here that a large part of the English and French proletariat is alreadyÂ <em>conscious</em>Â of its historic task and is constantly working to develop that consciousness into complete clarity.â€Â <a href="#fnref:9" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>The following note perhaps clarifies what I mean by â€œuniversalismâ€ here. David Graeber makes a remark somewhere in <em>Debt</em> regarding the tendency for, following great natural or economic disasters, the old identifications of society to temporarily become irrelevant and an instinctual egalitarianismâ€”which he calls â€œbaseline communismâ€â€”to kick in. After all, when the world is on fire and livelihoods have been destroyed on a mass scale, whether one is rich or poor simply doesnâ€™t matter any more: the brute priority just to <em>survive</em> temporarily suspends the meaning and use of these kinds of particular identifications. I would add, though, that this doesnâ€™t just happen in apocalyptic scenarios; it also accompanies some of the most joyful and sublime moments of our lives. In amidst the chanting crowd of a protest, rave or football match, there are, occasionally, distinct moments where time seems to contract into a single point, and all the prior identifications and baggage that everyone usually has hanging around their necks become totally irrelevant: all that matters is that each and every one of us is right here, right now, as witnesses to an Event. It is precisely this indifference to difference, this temporary dissolution of particularities, that proletarian politics aspires toâ€”and it can only do this by daring to take the centre stage, by daring to speak â€œfor allâ€.Â <a href="#fnref:XX" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
