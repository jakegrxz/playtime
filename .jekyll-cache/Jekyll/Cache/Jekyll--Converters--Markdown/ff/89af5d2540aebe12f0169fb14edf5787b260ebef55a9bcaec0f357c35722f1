<p>Halfway through Samuel Beckettâ€™s excellent <em>Malone Dies</em>, the titular character details a highly evocative visual metaphor that quickly gets right to the heart of the Beckettian project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€¦Â I feel it my duty to say that it is never light in this place, never really light. The light is there, outside, the air sparkles, the granite wall across the way glitters with all its mica, the light is against my window, but it does not come through. So that here all bathes, I will not say in shadow, nor even in half-shadow, but in a kind of leaden light that makes no shadow, so that it is hard to say from what direction it comes, for it seems to come from all directions at once, and with equal force. (p.58)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can picture it in your mindâ€™s eye: a dull light that illuminates basically nothing apart from indiscriminate amorphous pools of dark colour that we can barely perceive, that for all intents and purposes is not â€œlightâ€ at all. And yet, this is not simply darkness eitherâ€¦ there is <em>something</em> that we sense, but without any of the clarity that light is supposed to bringâ€¦</p>

<p>It is not just Maloneâ€™s room that is bathed in this eerie â€œleaden lightâ€, which he evokes multiple times throughout the book: it is seemingly the entirety of Beckettâ€™s oeuvre. Beckettâ€™s characters are often decrepit, impotent, forgetful and elderly figures that stalk not just at the fringes of society (for example in mental institutions) but also at the fringes of the human itself.Â  Constantly reflecting on and editing the texts which they are purportedly the author, flitting from one topic to the next, his characters seem to lack any of the regularity or constancy that define human interiority. And yet, they stubbornly remain human: with a dark and bleak sense of humour, they continue to think, walk about, and even have sex. Much like the leaden light, we can grasp at â€œsomethingâ€ with Beckettâ€™s characters, but paradoxically <em>because</em> of this, they remain unclear, dark, â€œnothingâ€.</p>

<p>It is precisely this commitment to the eerie, contradictory fringes that makes Beckettâ€™s books often challenging and difficult to read: absent a plot or characters in any substantial or coherent sense, the major footholds a reader typically depends on when reading are gone. For most people, this amounts to a cardinal sin, and an immediate turn-off: why read a book where nothing happens? Where we know essentially nothing about the characters involved? Why are there pages, indeed a whole physical book, when really there should be none? Indeed, for most people these are entirely legitimate questions, and the â€œcommon senseâ€, instinctual reaction to Beckettâ€™s works would be to stop reading after 20 pages and tell everyone you know how boring the book was. But such criticisms, rather than seriously invalidating Beckettâ€™s works, actually demonstrate the radicality of the philosophical claims they make on us. For in order to seriously engage with and enjoy them, Beckettâ€™s works demand nothing less than this: that we adopt a whole new ontology, an ontology <em>right at the limits of ontology itself</em>.</p>

<p>The central philosophical question prompted by Beckett is this: how do we think nothingness without turning it into a â€œsomethingâ€? How do we think a being that, paradoxically, is nothing? What kind of â€œbeingâ€ is the leaden light?</p>
