<p>As tru fans of the blog will remember, over the first two months of Covid lockdown I ran an almost-daily email newsletter called LOCKDOWNTIME, which sent out a variety of music/TV/film/book recommendations to give people some good cultural nourishment while being trapped inside their homes. <a href="https://playtime.substack.com/">The archive of these posts can be accessed here</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as I returned to work and lost the free time that lockdown afforded, I was unable to keep up sending so many recs, and wanted to focus on writing more in-depth blog posts (e.g. my posts <a href="https://www.underscoreblog.com/archive/2020/07/05/leaden-light-proletariat.html">on Beckett</a> and <a href="https://www.underscoreblog.com/archive/2020/07/24/tony-sopranos-secret.html">The Sopranos</a>). Consequently, I quietly dropped LOCKDOWNTIME in early June, planning to return in some way at some point.</p>

<p>Thanks to some technical re-jigging, I can now say that: <em>the recs newsletter is back</em>. What Iâ€™ve done is <strong>merge the blog and the newsletter</strong>. By subscribing to the newsletter below, you not only get alerts of new blog posts, but also all the kinds of recs that I enjoyed sharing via LOCKDOWNTIME. Unlike LOCKDOWNTIME, though, these recs have no set frequency. I will send them out whenever I feel like it or come across something I really like. The vibe will generally be a lot more low-key than the blog.</p>
