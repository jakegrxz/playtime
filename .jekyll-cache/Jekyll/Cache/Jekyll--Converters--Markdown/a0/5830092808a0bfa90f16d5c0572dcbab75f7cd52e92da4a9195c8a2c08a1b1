I" <p>Just to while away the time, Iâ€™ve been trying to list what my â€“ and I suspect many othersâ€™ â€“ writing tics are, especially when writing theory/criticism. (The tics Iâ€™ve identified below I know for a fact I have obtained through reading Anglosphere theory/criticism/philosophy, so it canâ€™t just be me afflicted by them.) Iâ€™ll explain more below, but this isnâ€™t to mock or shame people: there would be no language without repeated turns of phrase (tics), and we all have them. Iâ€™m just interested to see what happens when we elevate them from unconscious reflexes to the level of conscious reflection.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s some Iâ€™ve identified, in both myself and others, off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>â€¦, of course, â€¦:</strong> This is my worst offender, I think, largely because I donâ€™t even use it as itâ€™s meant to be used. I use it usually to add rhythm or a breather to sentences, rather than to express something thatâ€™s actually obvious and would therefore allow an â€œof courseâ€. The result is that it just comes off as pretentious and performative.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Far fromâ€¦</strong>: E.g. â€œFar from escaping desire for the cherished realm of dispassionate objectivity, anxious attempts to rein back â€œsubjectivistâ€ desire only further demonstrate it through their jittery acts of denial.â€ (from an old blog post of mine â€“ there are plenty of examplesâ€¦).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Against theâ€¦:</strong> Interchangeable with the above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The story goes like this</strong>: Largely big in theory-fiction/accelerationist writing, inspired by Nick Landâ€™s â€œ<a href="https://medium.com/@kissmeiamsick/meltdown-nick-land-c94f56278ae5">Meltdown</a>â€. E.g. I noticed it on <a href="https://psuedoanalysis.blogspot.com/2020/07/freudomarxism-cia-psyop-to-delegitimize.html">the Psuedoanalysis blog</a> (again, this isnâ€™t to mock â€“ the blogâ€™s one of my favourites, and Iâ€™ve learnt a lot about psychoanalysis through it)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Italicising</em> almost <em>every</em> other <em>word</em>:</strong> I shamelessly do â€“ and stand by â€“ this, but I do notice itâ€™s something that only theory/philosophy seems to do. How often do you see it in fiction or more factual non-fiction?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Here, I want toâ€¦:</strong> Iâ€™m trying to present tics neutrally here, but this one does get on my nerves. Itâ€™s something I see more in strictly academic writing like journal articles or PhD theses, and it reeks of academic self-flagellation. If youâ€™ve written something, you donâ€™t <em>want</em> to do something, you <em>have</em> done something! Just say â€œIâ€™m going to..â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>â€¦, and is this not the â€¦?:</strong> Zizek does this a lot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>â€¦ - and this is precisely the point - â€¦</strong>: Ditto, but I like it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Itâ€™s interesting: where do you stop when listing writing tics? Because I could easily extend the above list: I could have included particular sentence structures (something which the â€œFar fromâ€¦â€ tic hints towards), particular ways of opening or introducing pieces, particular neologisms or words, particular topics, particular citations, particular uses of punctuation, particular likes and dislikes, etc, etcâ€¦</p>

<p>The answer is that, well, you canâ€™t: <em>writing is, by nature, a kind of tic</em>. Or, more generally: <em>language is a kind of tic</em>. Instead of being the perfect representation of an individual self-consciousness, language is by definition adopted through a cumulative imitation of external speakers, which we then interiorise and eventually use automatically. Rather than a (self-)conscious, linguistically coherent thought occurring before every act of speaking/writing, language is simultaneously <em>more than</em> and <em>less than</em> the subject. More than because language always comes from, and is directed towards, the external Other; less than because its use is determined primarily by pragmatics and unconscious reflexes, rather than being grounded in a self-conscious intention prior to language. In other words, language lacks an interior; it exists purely on the outside, for the outside; and it is for this reason that William Burroughs famously described language <a href="https://realitystudio.org/texts/electronic-revolution/">as a <em>virus</em></a>.</p>
