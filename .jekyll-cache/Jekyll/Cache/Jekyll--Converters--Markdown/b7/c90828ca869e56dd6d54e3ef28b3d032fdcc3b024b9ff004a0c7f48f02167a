<p><em>The wager of this piece is as follows: it is incumbent on communists to think the <strong>commun-</strong>, stemming from the Indo-European root <strong>kom</strong> (beside; near; with) and the Latin <strong>mÅ«nus</strong> (a service; a duty or obligation; a favour; a spectacle; a gift), itself stemming from the Proto-Indo-European root <strong>*mey</strong>: *to change.</em></p>

<p>We begin by acknowledging that the first goal of any radical leftist political practice is the activation, or raising to the level of self-consciousness, of common ties that had hitherto been obfuscated by force and in the interest of the oppressor<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Whether it be among workers, people of colour, migrants, prisoners, women, queer people, and so on, the initial aim is always to bring people together who the powerful wanted kept apart and compartmentalised. We seek the construction of that initial rowdy meeting, where workers who have never spoken to each other despite working in the same place start talking and making bonds, where women find out they are not alone in the face of belittlement and harassment by the men they encounter, and where migrants who have long felt almost hysterically dislocated from the society into which they have migrated find others who have felt the same impacts of xenophobic alienation. To go even further, we seek <em>the meetings after the meeting</em>, those initial friendly conversations between the meetingâ€™s participants on the bus home, or outside sharing a cigarette, about anything in particularâ€¦ Those first signs of a budding, the sprouting of something new, matched by the excitement and nervousness about what it could become.</p>

<p>What is the nature of these â€œcommon tiesâ€ â€“ what does it mean to hold <em>in common</em>? We can begin to reach an answer here by noting how <em>the common</em> is different from the <em>equivalent</em> or <em>identical</em>. While the statement â€œA is identical to Bâ€ proposes that A=B, â€œA has X in common with Bâ€ does not propose that A equals B at all â€“ simply that they are both somehow involved with the common third term X. To state the obvious, A and B can be drastically different in numerous ways, and still have <em>something</em> â€“ X â€“ in common. (This all appears obvious, but I state it to stress the fact that while we often think of communities as founded on a principle of identity or homogeneity, the opposite is true: communities are instead founded on a principle of <em>difference</em>, on that â€œsomething extraâ€ that must exceed the common term X.)</p>

<p>This leads us to that mysterious X â€“ the commonly-held thing which we will hereafter term the <em>common X</em>. Now, this X is a strange entity: while it must possess some degree of repetition in order to hold the community together and give it some consistency, it is also something that necessarily exists <em>in excess of</em> any â€œsingularityâ€ (e.g. individual person, television programme, social media platform, whatever). The common X <em>traverses</em> all singularities â€“ it cuts across and surpasses them, in order to â€œconnectâ€ them. Consider the diagram below<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup>: here we have a â€œcommunityâ€ of four parts, #1-4, which all share some common characteristic, X. If we want to consider the common X <em>in itself</em>, rather than simply as a characteristic of some specific part, we are forced to cut across and traverse all the four parts, leading to the sketchy pink box in the diagram. This â€œboxâ€, however, is quite unlike the others in the diagram, which depict specific parts with some kind of demarcating line between â€œinsideâ€ and â€œoutsideâ€. For the repeated Xs in the pink common box are not simply a collection of elements, as in a part-box; they are instead the repeated iterations of â€œoneâ€ consistent plateau â€“ X â€“ in different particulars. The common X therefore lacks any principle of interiority: to borrow a phrase from <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em>, the common X â€œexists only through the outside and on the outsideâ€<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup> â€“ interiority is alien to it. The X has a singularity and consistency, but no (self-)identity; and it is precisely this quality that allows it to hold together disparate parts, founding a community or commons.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/img/comm_diagram_1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>At the â€œcentreâ€ of any community<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">4</a></sup>, then, is this mysterious common X, this element held in common that the community in a way â€œhingesâ€ around. Take, for example, the community around a particular school: that amalgamated multiplicity of friendships between pupils, after school clubs, relationships between parents, after work drinks between teachers, the conversations in the staff kitchen between cleaners on their break, weekend sports matches, school trips, and so on. Here, the common X may not appear mysterious at all â€“ is it not simply the school, as a material â€œthingâ€ made of bricks which teachers inside, etc? Yes and no: while a stable material structure is no doubt essential for a school â€“ and thereby a school community â€“ to exist and flourish, so long as we conceive of this structure as simply a â€œthingâ€ in the commonly understood sense of the term (i.e. an â€œobviousâ€ object of our consciousness that we can manipulate and control), we will never be able to explain what actually drives or constitutes the school community. For remember, <em>the common X is not a â€œthingâ€</em> in the usual sense of the word (i.e. an individual, obvious/transparent, controllable object), but something that <em>traverses</em> such individuated â€œthingsâ€, that cuts across and exceeds them. It is, to use the conceptual language of Gilbert Simondon, not an individual but <em>transindividual</em><sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Lest this sound overly jargony, let us specify this example some more. Take two children: one is a bookworm and a teachersâ€™ pet, and comes from a middle-class home; the other has had bouts of low attendance because of poor mental health and an unstable family life, and comes from a more working-class background. While the former thoroughly enjoys school and feels â€œat homeâ€ in class, going to clubs and bantering with the teachers, the latter finds the disciplinary environment of the school profoundly alienating, struggles to engage in class, and consequently thoroughly dislikes school. Both of these children are in the same school, potentially in the same class, even sat next to one another â€“ and yet each has an experience of school that their classmate would find basically impossible to genuinely imagine or relate to. So on the one hand, we have â€œthe schoolâ€ presenting itself to us as a fun, rewarding environment; on the other we have â€œthe schoolâ€ as an alienating, harsh, and confusing institution. Bring in even more students into this example, and we could add â€œschool as boringâ€ to the mix, â€œschool as racistâ€, â€œschool as sexistâ€, â€œschool as funnyâ€, etc, etc â€“ how is it that one â€œthingâ€ can present itself to us with so many faces? The usual interpretation of such a problem is simply to argue that these are just different â€œopinionsâ€ held by the different students at the school â€“ in this reading, the differences are â€œcolonisedâ€ or â€œdomesticatedâ€ by the individual subject; each different perspective on school becomes a property possessed by the individual, subordinating difference to identity. In other words, here we read the differences <em>on the side of the individual subject(s)</em>, conceived as a separate, self-contained Wholeness. The more radical reading, however, is to posit that these internal gaps or fissures <em>are on the side of the â€œschool-in-commonâ€ itself</em> â€“ it is the school as the common X which is split, fractured, internally differentiated, and it is precisely this internal fracturing that enables it to be the basis or â€œcentreâ€ of the school community. When two students from the same school express different opinions about school, this tells us less about the â€œinner truthâ€ of each studentâ€™s personality/individuality but rather, on the contrary, demonstrates the internal differentiation of the commonality â€œschoolâ€ itself.</p>

<p>Consequently, the common X at the centre of our imagined school community is not simply â€œthe schoolâ€ as some simple object consisting of bricks and teachers, but instead what we have called the <em>school-in-common</em>, a strange entity that cuts across and exceeds all the singular elements that hold the school in common (students, teachers, parents, the bricks, the earth beneath it). As we have demonstrated, in order to cut across and connect singularities like it does, the school-in-common (or â€œcommon Xâ€) cannot be a fixed, positive, transparent object: instead it is perpetually fracturing itself, <em>emptying</em> itself of any determinate content. The â€œgenerating principleâ€ of any community, then, is never some Master or Leader who stands tall at the centre and proclaims to symbolise the community and speak for it â€œas a wholeâ€, giving it some kind of fullness/presence. No â€“ such a proclamation is always the retroactive attempt to paper over and fill in the self-emptying void of the common X that is the primary basis and â€œgenerating principleâ€ for any community<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">6</a></sup>. The common X incessantly splits itself, differs from itself, and it is through such self-differentiation that it becomes open <em>to the outside</em>, that it extends its commonality and builds/generates the community. In contrast to the figure of the Master-Leader who claims to symbolise and â€œbeâ€ it, the community is, then, instead always <em>centred at its edges</em>: it is the way a community â€œbudsâ€ at its fringes, self-differentiates, or changes itself that defines what it <em>is</em>. The communityâ€™s <em>becoming</em> is its <em>being</em>.</p>

<p>This is all, naturally, difficult to wrap oneâ€™s head around. Primarily, this because no one ever directly experiences the â€œschool-in-commonâ€ <em>in itself</em>; the â€œcommon Xâ€ is not an object that is given at the level of our individual experience and (self-)consciousness. Why? <em>Because it necessarily exceeds all individual experience</em>. If it did not, we would not have a community, but rather a series of detached individual elements â€“ the good and the bad student would be trapped inside their own personal prisons with nothing in common, least of all going to the same school. Thinking and understanding community therefore necessitates that we think in terms of <em>difference</em>, rather than <em>identity â€“</em> and part of such a thinking involves accepting that at the centre of any community is <em>an absence</em>, an <em>incompleteness</em>. For as soon as we identify a community with some positive object given in experience (â€œthe centre of the school community is the school as a simple, obvious, material objectâ€) <em>we fail to understand the community as such</em>, we â€œkillâ€ it.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>(It is all somewhat like an asteroid orbiting the Earth; as anyone who has studied physics or mechanics knows, a thing in orbit is technically â€œfallingâ€ towards its gravitational centre point â€“ in other words, the asteroid is technically falling <em>towards</em> Earth, compelled by the force of gravity. Due to the speed and angle of its departing flight path, however, it never reaches Earth. One can thus imagine us as aliens on an orbiting asteroid, constantly under the impression we are about to hit our gravitational centre, the mysterious X at the centre of our community â€“ but always doomed to fail, for to hit the centre would be kill the orbit, or in our analogy, <em>the community itself</em>â€¦)</p>

      <p>This was originally a fragment from what was to be a multi-part series of posts on social media that I had been very gradually and haphazardly adding to since last May, and intended to publish here early this year. Other projects have come up, though, and as a whole the series feels already like something that I have moved beyond, so I have decided to drop it. This fragment, however, I still like, and think stands on its own two feet. Again, I have already â€œmoved beyondâ€ certain bits of it, but a lot of it still works, and itâ€™s good to have some kind of testament to the months of work that ultimately led up to it.Â <a href="#fnref:0" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Like all the diagrams in this piece, this is ridiculously speculative. The diagrams presented here are simply little drawings I have made to set some thoughts into motion, and while they undoubtedly claim <em>some</em> productive and clear relationship to â€œthe Truthâ€, they equally do not claim to accurately â€œbeâ€ or â€œrepresentâ€ it either. (This is a bad approach to diagrams in general, anyway.) The â€œrigorousâ€ logician or mathematician would no doubt balk at this approach; in particular I can imagine a set theorist picking apart and redrawing this diagram quite ferociously, reconceiving the boxed parts here as round sets, which all intersect Venn diagram-style over the shared element X. This intersection â€“ which in mathematical notation would take the form #1 âˆ© #2 âˆ© #3 âˆ© #4 â€“ could then be described as its own particular set of its own, ridding the â€œcommon Xâ€ of all its â€œstrange featuresâ€ I discuss here. I canâ€™t claim to have the knowledge to counter this, but I do have a sense that the set theory approach freezes and fixes the necessarily dynamic movement in commonality, thereby ironically <em>mis</em>representing it. However you feel about that explanation, Badiouâ€™s <em>Being and Event</em> is in the post as we speak, which leans on set theory quite a lot, so this isnâ€™t the end of this line of thoughtâ€¦Â <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>In his seminars on postcapitalist desire, Mark Fisher states how he dislikes the term â€œcommunityâ€ because it suggests an â€œinâ€ and an â€œoutâ€ of the community. I share Fisherâ€™s weariness about the term, but note that his uneasiness comes from a reaction to a communitarian or nationalist appropriation of the term â€œcommunityâ€ that, as the theorising in this post is explicitly shows, is in fact a <em>botched</em> notion of community that subordinates it to some racialised Master-Leader. The right may be the ones speaking the language of â€œcommunityâ€, but we should be open in exposing this as a wolf in sheepâ€™s clothing, and assert instead that a <em>correct</em> theorisation of community, or collectivity, is indispensable to the Left. (As an aside, it is worth noting that Fisher was perfectly comfortable with and supportive of the notion of â€œcollectivesâ€, stating in a <a href="http://k-punk.abstractdynamics.org/archives/004109.html">2004 blog post</a> that â€œthere is no more urgent task on this hell planet than the production of rational collectivitiesâ€, for example. If one is uneasy about the use of â€œcommunityâ€ in this post, then, you can simply swap out the word â€œcommunityâ€ for â€œcollectiveâ€ and rest easy in the knowledge that you have â€œgot itâ€.)Â <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>And such a â€œfilling inâ€ often has disastrous consequences: as Zizek notes in both <em>The Sublime Object of Ideology</em> and <em>The Ticklish Subject</em>, it is this attempt to fill in and â€œgentrifyâ€ the emptiness at the centre of any community that defines totalitarianism <em>as such</em>. The problem with Stalinism, for instance, is that the Party/Leader claims to stand in for, or coincide with, the People <em>in toto</em> without any leftover, meaning that any slight deviation from the Partyâ€™s/Leaderâ€™s rules â€“ as inevitably happens, such is the nature of community sketched above â€“ is construed as a deviation <em>against the People</em>, and therefore in need of violent repression. The truth of the matter is, though, that this act of deviation, far from being an act <em>against</em> the People, is what constitutes the People <em>as such</em>.Â <a href="#fnref:5" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
